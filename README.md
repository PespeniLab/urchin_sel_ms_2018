# Purple Sea Urchin Sequence Pool-seq Capture Selection Experiment

This repository holds scripts for the analysis of a purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, selection experiment.

Original experiment was completed on ?? where 25 adult urchins were spawned and resulting embryos were exposed to low pH or control conditions. Pools of larvae sequenced to > 50x coverage to identify adaptive changes in allele frequency in response to low pH selection.

## data availability

Sequence data: link coming soon.

GO annotations were retrived from ensembl on 2/18/18 and exported though biomart. This correponds to assembly Spur_3.1. http://metazoa.ensembl.org/Strongylocentrotus_purpuratus/Info/Index
